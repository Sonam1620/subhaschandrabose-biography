    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made 
        him a hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and 
        Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military 
        failure. The honorific Netaji (Bengali: "Respected Leader") was first applied to Bose 
        in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German 
        and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used
        throughout India.
        Subhas Chandra Bose is considered the most influential freedom fighter with extraordinary leadership
        skills and a charismatic orator. His famous slogans are 'tum mujhe khoon do, main tumhe aazadi dunga',
        'Jai Hind', and 'Delhi Chalo'. He formed Azad Hind Fauj and made several contributions to India's freedom 
        struggle. He is known for his militant approach that he used to gain independence and for his socialist policies.
